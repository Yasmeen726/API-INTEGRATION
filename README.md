Allow users to search for weather information by entering a city name.
Utilize the OpenWeatherMap API to fetch weather data (temperature, description, location).
Display the fetched weather information (temperature, description, location) on the webpage.
Optionally, display the user's current location's weather using geolocation.
Include basic error handling for API requests and geolocation.
Implement a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

Application Description:
The weather application is a simple web application that provides users with current weather information.

Key Features:
City Search: Users can enter a city name in a search bar to get the weather for that specific location.
Geolocation: The application can use the user's current location (if permitted by the browser) to display the local weather.
Weather Information: Displays the current temperature, weather description (e.g., "Clear," "Cloudy," "Rainy"), and location name.
Weather Icon: Displays a relevant weather icon based on the weather description.
User Interface: Features a clean and modern design with a user-friendly interface.
Error Handling: Provides informative error messages for invalid city searches, API request failures, and geolocation errors.

Technologies Used:
HTML: For structuring the content of the webpage.
CSS: For styling the appearance and layout of the application.
JavaScript: For handling user interactions, fetching weather data from the API, and updating the displayed information.
OpenWeatherMap API: For providing weather data.

 This is a basic description. The application can be further enhanced with features like:
Temperature Unit Conversion: Allow users to switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
More Detailed Weather Information: Display additional details like humidity, wind speed, etc.
Improved User Interface: Implement a more visually appealing design with better responsiveness across different devices.
Offline Functionality: Allow users to view previously searched locations or cached weather data.
